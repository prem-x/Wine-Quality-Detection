# Wine Quality Detection

Welcome to the **Wine Quality Detection** project! üç∑ This repository contains a comprehensive approach to predicting wine quality based on various features in the dataset. The project uses **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** for data manipulation, exploration, and visualization, with an additional focus on detecting patterns, outliers, and building insightful visualizations.

## üìù Project Overview

The objective of this project is to explore a dataset of red wine quality, predict wine quality based on various features, and uncover key relationships between these features. The dataset consists of multiple attributes of wines, including chemical properties like acidity, alcohol content, and pH, along with the target variable ‚Äî wine quality.

By leveraging **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and data preprocessing, we aim to build a better understanding of how these variables interact and how they influence wine quality.

## üîé Dataset Information

The dataset consists of **1599 entries** and **12 columns**. Each row represents a wine sample, and the columns are a combination of chemical and physical properties, as well as the target variable: **quality**. 

## Dataset Link : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality

### Columns:

- **fixed acidity**
- **volatile acidity**
- **citric acid**
- **residual sugar**
- **chlorides**
- **free sulfur dioxide**
- **total sulfur dioxide**
- **density**
- **pH**
- **sulphates**
- **alcohol**
- **quality** (target variable)

The **quality** column is a score from **0 to 10**, indicating the overall quality of the wine based on expert evaluation.

## üìä Key Objectives

### 1. **Load and Manipulate Data Using Pandas and NumPy**
   - Load the wine quality dataset.
   - Inspect basic information and statistics about the dataset.
   - Handle missing data and perform initial data cleaning.

### 2. **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to Uncover Patterns**
   - Investigate missing values, unique values, and statistical characteristics of the features.
   - Uncover hidden patterns and relationships between the different variables.

### 3. **Analyze Feature Relationships Using Correlation and Covariance**
   - Explore how various features (like acidity, alcohol, pH) correlate with each other and with the target variable, **quality**.
   - Use correlation heatmaps and covariance matrices to visualize feature relationships.

### 4. **Detect and Interpret Outliers in the Dataset**
   - Detect outliers using the **Interquartile Range (IQR)** method.
   - Visualize outliers through box plots and analyze their potential impact on model accuracy.

### 5. **Visualize the Data Using Graphs and Charts for Insights**
   - Create distribution plots, pairplots, and heatmaps to gain deeper insights into the wine dataset.
   - Investigate the relationship between wine quality, alcohol content, and pH levels.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for analysis and data manipulation.
- **Pandas**: For data handling and manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and handling of data arrays.
- **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**: For data visualization and exploratory analysis.

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites:

1. Install Python (version 3.x recommended).
2. Install the required libraries using the following commands:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

### Steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wine-quality-detection.git
```

2. Navigate into the project folder:
